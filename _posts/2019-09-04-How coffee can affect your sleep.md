## Anecdotal evidence for a good start
---
I love coffee. As a student, I worked as a barista for over four years. Every day, I had an unlimited and - most importantly - free access to a quality brew. I became a real coffee snob, 
who drank speciality coffee (preferably from Kenya) and strongly believed that coffee “doesn’t work on me anymore and I can drink it anytime”.  However, I struggled with a constant feeling of being tired. It was freaking me out because I always made sure to sleep at least 7h. 
I woke up every night around 3 am but always dismissed it as a result of a vivid dream. 
But then I read ‘Why we sleep?’ by Matthew Walker and I started to connect the dots between my constant tiredness and a disrupting effects of coffee on deep sleep. 
It turns out that just like other good things, sleep is more about quality rather than quantity. But let’s move on from a world of anecdotal evidence and take a look at some science behind it!

## How coffee affects your brain?
---

Coffee contains caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) which is a stimulant for the central nervous system. 
Thanks to its revitalising properties, caffeine is the most popular psychoactive drug in the world. 
Caffeine-infused drinks are daily consumed by 85% of the US population (Mitchel et al., 2014). 
However, it is difficult to estimate precisely how much caffeine an average person consumes, 
due to its common use in a variety of products (Brice & Smith, 2002). But how does it affect your brain?
> Caffeine blocks adenosine, one of the main sleep-inducing molecules in our body. 

Neurons have special receptors for adenosine and when it accumulates in your brain and reaches the receptor, 
it tells your brain that it’s time to sleep. The more adenosine in your brain, the more sleepy you become. 
Caffeine is the adenosine antagonist, which means that it blocks the receptors before adenosine gets a chance to dock. 
They both have a similar molecular structure, which means that the caffeine can wedge into the adenosine receptors without activating them. 
As a consequence, caffeine pretends to be adenosine and you stay awake for longer. 
Caffeine molecules act mainly on A1 and A2A receptors which are linked to brain functions involved in sleep, arousal and cognition (Ribeiro & Sebastiao, 2010).  
With time your brain will adapt by producing more adenosine receptors and you’ll need to drink more coffee to stay alert. 

## The good, the bad and the ugly 
---
Caffeine has a multitude of positive effects (Smith, 2002). 
It can help to stay more alert and also reduce fatigue.  What’s more, it has been found to improve sustained attention (vigilance). 
> Moderate caffeine use could be beneficial and people appear to be good in controlling their caffeine consumption to maximise the mentioned positive effects. 

However, there’s a couple of hidden features of caffeine which many people are not aware of. Firstly, it stays in your organism for a very long time. 
Caffeine has three to ten hours half-life. It means that after you had your cup of coffee, 50% of caffeine it contained is still circulating in your body hours later (Temple et al., 2017). 
This is not a problem if you had your last coffee at 8 am. But if you drunk your last coffee at 4 pm, your organism won’t get rid of the caffeine until early morning the following day. 
> Effectively, caffeine in your system can not only make it difficult to fall asleep but also disrupt your sleep cycle. 

For example, caffeine consumption on a given day reduces the metabolism of melatonin which is so-called ‘’sleep hormone’’ (Shilo et al., 2002). 
Secondly, caffeine can decrease the amount of “deep sleep”, stages three and four of your sleep cycle. 
Deep sleep is known for its restorative properties, therefore when a person’s deep sleep is disrupted they are likely to wake up tired the next morning. 
A review examining the negative effect of caffeine on sleep (Clark and Landolt, 2016) confirmed that caffeine prolonged sleep latency, decreased the amount of sleep and most importantly, 
impaired the efficiency and quality of sleep. Caffeine reduced slow-wave sleep time (deep sleep signature) and increased wakefulness. 
Interestingly, caffeine can affect people’s sleep differently based on their age or genetic makeup  (Clark and Landolt, 2016). For example, the sleep of older people seems to be affected more than the sleep of young adults. 
Variations in the adenosine receptor gene ADORA2A can modulate individual response to stimulating properties of caffeine.
> The tricky part is that you won’t remember waking up in the night or having difficulty falling asleep – it’s difficult to make the connection and realise what’s the cause. 

Sleep deprivation has dire consequences ranging from lapses of attention and slower motor responses to reduced cognitive control (Goel et al., 2009; Slama et al., 2017). 
Effectively, you decide to have an additional cup of coffee for an extra boost and the vicious circle begins. 
Study on caffeine consumption and sleep quality among Australians showed that greater caffeine consumption is associated with shorter sleep and that people with reduced sleep quality would consume more caffeine (Watson et al., 2016).
Similarly, a large study on over fifteen thousand adolescents which also examined the influence of caffeine intake on sleep, showed that subjects reporting high caffeine intake were more likely to be tired in the morning than subjects who reported much lower consumption (Orbeta et al.,2006).

## Conclusion
---
This article doesn’t aim to discourage anyone from drinking coffee or other caffeinated beverages! But I think it’s very important to be aware of its negative effects so that it’s possible to mitigate them. Caffeine consumption is very normalised in our culture so it’s especially important to question its ‘harmlessness’. I couldn't give up caffeine completely. 
I still drink decaf coffee and green tea and try to have only one or two early in the morning. 
My sleep improved and I don’t feel as tired as before (but it could be a placebo effect). Nevertheless, it seems like to work!
