## To be or not to be Mindfull?
---

It's the middle of the neverending Covid-19 pandemic. 
Everybody’s life has been affected and it’s nearly impossible not to lose your mind and calmly anticipate what's going to happen next. 
Consequently, the idea of self-care and mindfulness got a bit more recognition recently. 
Numerous articles recommend using this unstable time to give mindfulness a shot and learn how to appreciate a break from everyday life. 
As a meditator, I couldn’t agree more and after experiencing some benefits from my practice, I could honestly recommend it to anybody. 
As a sceptic though, 
I decided to take a closer look at the empirical research on mindfulness and how (or if) they live up to the mindfulness hype, monetised by the wellness industry.


## History
---

Despite the recent surge in popularity, mindfulness meditation has been around in the West since the early 19th century (Rau & Williams, 2016). 
At first, it was closely associated with the Buddhist tradition but soon became modernised. Psychologists became interested in mindfulness when Jon Kabat-Zim created ‘the Stress Reduction Clinic’ in 1979. Kabat-Zim formed the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) to help his patients with their chronic illnesses symptoms and facilitate relaxation and stress reduction (Rau & Williams, 2016). Till today, MBSR a standard for mindfulness interventions. Zinn's secularised depiction of mindfulness as an 'internal resource' vastly contributed to its success (Santorelli & Kabat-Zinn, 2013). Mindfulness meditation has become mainstream within the last decade and is now a synonym for well-being and self-care. It has been reported to improve mental health in patients with PTSD, depression, anxiety, eating disorders and substance abuse (Coronado-Montoya et al., 2016). It's also used as a tool for stress reduction and anxiety among healthy people. American Psychological Association (APA) and the UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, recommend Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy to prevent remission of depression and relapse. It has even been observed that Mindfulness could not only alter your neural functions but also the brain's structure (Fox et al., 2014). Does it mean that we finally discovered a panacea for all of our mental struggles? Well, I can only say that it's a little bit more complicated than that. 

## Many faces of Mindfulness
---
One of the main challenges in mindfulness research is the lack of a consistent definition and methodology. 

> Mindfulness is an umbrella term, most commonly associated with focused attention, awareness and being 'in the present moment' (Lutz et al., 2008).

In practice, mindfulness could be equated to a 10 minutes daily meditation, 8-weeks long meditation retreat or simply a self-report questionnaire, about various personality domains associated with being "mindful". Consequently, this lack of methodological consistency makes it difficult to establish the universal benefits of mindfulness. Even though some clinical trials would find an eight weeks meditation MBSR intervention useful, does it mean we can get a similar outcome from 10 minutes of daily practice? It's worth noticing that the idea of a "novice meditator" also differs from study to study (Van Dam et al., 2017). In some studies, a beginner is someone who meditated up to 100 hours in their life and for others, it means someone who has never meditated in their life. Consequently, the lack of methodological coherence makes it difficult to conduct a reliable meta-analysis to see the magnitude of benefits from meditation. 

## Mind the Hype
---
Coronado-Montoya et al., (2016) analysed 124 positive clinical trials on mindfulness. 
Authors found that 108 out of 124 studies reported more than one positive outcome of eight weeks MBSR intervention and 109 studies concluded it has therapeutic potential. 
Sounds great, but given the sample size and statistical power of investigated trials, it's 1.6 times more positive results than possible! 
It could be due to the publication bias, which means either that only positive outcome studies get published or due to a selective reporting of only positive trials. 
Few meta-analyses found additional methodological limitations. Sedlemeir and colleagues (2012) found that less than 10% of studies she reviewed, used an active control group (for example sham meditation instead 
of just no treatment at all). The lack of a proper control group leaves room for confounding variables and placebo effects. 
A meta-analysis of studies of MBSR influence on compassion, empathy and aggression, showed a peculiar bias. 

> Studies which found an increase in compassion after meditation tended to have the same person as an MBSR teacher and one of the authors. 

It doesn't mean that authors faked the data, it only shows that scientists need to carefully design their studies, to avoid the "researcher bias". 
What's more, selecting participants who already strongly believe in the benefits of mindfulness could affect the results (Van Dam et al., 2017). 
Lastly, the media often exaggerate the scientific findings on mindfulness (or any other topic to be honest) and fail to give a comprehensive explanation of a study. 

## Mindful Healing

One of the biggest misconceptions about mindfulness is that there's solid evidence for its clinical efficacy and that it can be used as a therapeutic tool. 
In reality, the evidence is pretty mixed (Van Dam et al., 2017). Some studies found that MBSR works no better than conventional therapy, others that it's superior or even worse 
(Arch et al., 2013; Goldin et al., 2016; Goldberg et al., 2018). Effects of MBSR also seem to differ between various disorders. Goyal et al., (2014) 
in their meta-analysis of 3515 subjects of clinical trials of MBSR showed a moderate effect on improving symptoms of anxiety, pain or depression and only a low effect on stress and life quality. 
Researches found no proof that MBSR is better than any other active treatment (drugs, CBT, exercises) or that it has any effect on mood, attention, substance use, sleep or weight gain (Goyal et al., 2014). 
Why is the MBSR recommended by the APA and UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence? Van Dam et al (2017) blames the selective reporting. 

> Of course, this recommendation is not without a premise - mindfulness looks like a promising technique but more good quality research is needed to yet confirm its clinical efficacy. 

What's more, it's cheap and very safe (although experiencing strong anxiety and negative thoughts have been reported as an aversive effect) (Van Dam et al., 2017).

## Inside the Mind

Fox et al., (2014) conducted a meta-analysis of 21 studies (300 meditators) to answer two questions: is meditation associated with changes in the brain morphology 
and if yes, what's the magnitude of these changes? Over the years, researchers found consistent evidence of eight brain regions, altered among meditators. 
These areas were key to meta-awareness (frontopolar cortex), body awareness (insula and sensory cortices), memory and emotion regulation (hippocampus and amygdala) 
as well as regions responsible for communication between hemispheres (Corpus callosum) (Fox et al., 2014). Gotink et al. (2016) confirmed that MBSR could improve emotion regulation among meditators 
due to changes in the amygdala. Despite a decent, medium effect size for these findings, the authors raised a concern about the methodological weaknesses. 
For example, they notice that participants within the same sample practised various types of meditation. In the MRI studies, all of the participants' 
brains are usually averaged into one during the group level analysis, as an effect mixing several meditation practices. 
Researchers noticed that reviewed studies were conducted by the same research groups, which poses a risk of the overlapping sample. 

> It is worth mentioning that the causal effect of meditation on altering the brain structure is not very clear. 

First of all, meditation is a long-term practice which demands certain traits, such as openness or conscientiousness. 
Perhaps the brain morphology does not alter with practice but people with a certain morphology are more likely to maintain the practice in the first place? (Fox et al., 2014). 
On the other hand, Hölzel and colleagues (2011) showed that merely a few hours of meditation can induce neuroplastic changes in the brain. 
Furthermore, these alternations are of similar magnitude among long-term experienced meditators which mean that they don't change much over time. 
However, these rapid changes are not exclusive for meditation. Two hours of spatial learning could also alter the brain (Fox et al., 2014). 
All in all, there is evidence that mediation is associated with the brain morphology alterations, however, the direction of this relationship is not very clear.

## Summary 
---
Is meditation as universally beneficial and influential as it's portrayed? Probably not. 
But hey, nothing is. There's solid evidence out there that meditation could improve symptoms of many psychological disorders and overall quality of life. 
However, it will not fix all of our problems and it is definitely not better than a conventional Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. 
It's worth remembering that the research tends to be overhyped and that there's more work to be done on the methodology and study design. 
If you want to try it, go ahead it may or may not work for you. Just take it with a little grain of salt, and you'll be fine!
