##Hi there!

Welcome to my blog about the brain and cognition. 
I'm a research assistant in Cognitive Neuroscience and I would like to share some of the stuff I learnt with you! 
I believe that knowing more about the brain can make your life easier. It will make you more understanding of others and yourself. 
Our brains are amazing but imperfect organs and although being aware of our its flaws won't always let you avoid mistakes, it's a good start! 
I hope that with this blog I could help you develop critical thinking skills, 
needed to shed the false perceptions and navigate the modern world. Stay tuned!
